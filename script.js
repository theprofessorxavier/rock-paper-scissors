function getComputerChoice(){
    
}

console.log(Math.random());
// Create a new function named getComputerChoice.
// Write the code so that getComputerChoice will randomly return one of the following string values: “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”.
// Hint: The Math.random method returns a random number that’s greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. Think about how you can use this to conditionally return one of the multiple choices.
// Note: Some learners might think that arrays are necessary for this problem, but they aren’t. If you’re unfamiliar with arrays, don’t worry - they’ll be covered later in the curriculum.
